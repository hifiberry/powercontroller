# Flashing firmware to the power controller

## Enable serial port

On HiFiBerryOS, you first need to enable the serial p√ºort that's used to program the power controller

```
/opt/hifiberry/bin/enable-updi
```

This will disable the onboard Bluetoot controller! To re-enable it after flashing the firmware,
remove the line
```
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

from /boot/config.txt again.

## Check that the communication with the controller works

```
pyupdi -c /dev/ttyAMA0 -d mega808 -fr
```

## Copy the firmware

Just copy the compiled firmware to the Pi using scp. It should be an ".hex" file.

## Program firmware

```
pyupdi -c /dev/ttyAMA0 -d mega808 -f firmware.hex
```
